Haikon
======

This is my library for parsing HVIF vector icon files. 

There is quite a nice article about the format here: [500 Byte Images][2]. There is also a [Wikipedia][3] page.

[Here][1] is an example/ test page. 

This is all there is yet. Some glitches remain to be fixed and a few things are not (yet) supported, such as a.o. conicâ€“ and diamond gradients (they have to be emulated as svg does not support them natively).

The repository includes icon files from the haiku os as example files in the `examples/` directory. These were taken from [https://github.com/darealshinji/haiku-icons][4]
